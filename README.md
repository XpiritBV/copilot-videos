# copilot-videos

This repository showcases a web application that displays a grid of boxes on the main page, each representing a feature of GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise. The boxes are loaded from a local `data.json` file and are clickable, leading to detail pages. These detail pages contain the title of the feature, an inline video player showing a related video from YouTube, and a markdown description of the feature.

## Implementation

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data stored in a `data.json` file. This structure allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience, where users can explore various features of GitHub Copilot by clicking on the boxes.

## Running the Application in a GitHub Codespace

To run the application in a GitHub Codespace, simply open the repository in a Codespace. The environment is pre-configured to support the necessary development tools and extensions for a seamless development experience.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

The application can be published as a static website to GitHub Pages. This process involves setting up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the site whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Detailed instructions on how to set this up can be found in the repository's documentation.
